Now I'm not inclined to repeat myself anytime soon. >=(\n\n# Checks from different Systems\n\nLet's take a look at some d6-based games and how they resolve their rolls:\n\n- **Apocalypse World:** roll 2d6 and add their results; on a 10+ you succeed, on 7-9 you succeed but at a cost and on 6 or less you usually fail\n- **Blades in the Dark:** roll several d6 (usually 1-4) based on your stats and take the single highest result; you succeed on a 6 and even gain some extra on two 6s (critical success), a 4 or 5 is a partial success similar to the above and on a 1-3 \"it’s a bad outcome. Things go poorly. You probably don’t achieve your goal and you suffer complications, too\"^[quoted from https://bladesinthedark.com/core-system]\n- **Shadowrun:** you roll anything from 1 to 30 dice (usually about 3 to 12 though) and count all 5s, 6s (your successes) and 1s (if more than half of the rolled dice are 1s, you fail spectacularly); there are no baseline thresholds - sometimes you 'roll off' against the GM, sometimes there are rules to dictate the threshold and rather often the GM comes up with some arbitrary number you need to pass\n\nAdditionally there are ways to tinker with the results and alter the player's chances. In **AW** you sometimes flatly add (or substract) numbers to the result. **BitD** gives or takes dice to or from you and the same does **SR**, albeit with more dice.\n\nAs you can see, the first two examples are quite similar and pretty straight forward, whereas the third is a whole different kind of beast. This is why I'm writing this: I'll simulate the outcomes of the different approaches and try to find one that _feels shadowrun_ but resolves in a distinct way like with the other two.\n\n## Additional Mechanics\n\nI guess? Idk yet.\n\n\n# Simulations\n\n```{r simz}\n#| include: false\nn_rolls <- 2000\n\naw_base   <- replicate(n_rolls, sample(1:6, 2, replace = TRUE) |> sum()) %>% \n  as_tibble() %>% \n  transmute(\n    `2d6` = value,\n    `2d6 -1` = value - 1,\n    `2d6 +1` = value + 1,\n    `2d6 +2` = value + 2\n  ) %>% \n  gather() %>% \n  transmute(\n    game = \"AW\",\n    roll = key,\n    quality = case_when(\n      value > 9 ~ \"success\",\n      value > 6 ~ \"partial\",\n      TRUE ~ \"fail\"\n    ) \n  )\n\nbitd_base <- replicate(n_rolls, sample(1:6, 4, replace = TRUE)) %>% \n  t() %>% \n  as_tibble() %>% \n  transmute(\n    `4d6` = pmax(V1, V2, V3, V4),\n    `3d6` = pmax(V1, V2, V3),\n    `2d6` = pmax(V1, V2),\n    `1d6` = pmax(V1)\n  ) %>% \n  gather() %>% \n  transmute(\n    game  = \"BitD\",\n    roll = key,\n    quality = case_when(\n      value == 6 ~ \"success\",\n      value <= 3 ~ \"fail\",\n      TRUE ~ \"partial\"\n    ) \n  )\n\npdat <- bind_rows(bitd_base, aw_base) %>% \n  mutate(\n    conct_raw = paste(game, \"-\\n\", roll),\n    conct = factor(conct_raw, levels = c(\n      \"AW -\\n 2d6 -1\", \"BitD -\\n 1d6\",\n      \"AW -\\n 2d6\", \"BitD -\\n 2d6\",\n      \"AW -\\n 2d6 +1\", \"BitD -\\n 3d6\",\n      \"AW -\\n 2d6 +2\", \"BitD -\\n 4d6\"\n    )),\n    quality = factor(quality) %>% fct_rev()\n  )\n```\n\nThis is the interesting part. How do AW and BitD compare and how does SR fit in? I begin with sampling, oh let's just say, `r n_rolls` rolls - where 'a roll' is full skill check instead of single dice rolls. For simplicity, I only make `r n_rolls` rolls for each game once.\n\n```{r plot1}\n#| echo: false\n#| column: body\n#| fig-width: 10\n#| fig-height: 6\n\nggplot(pdat, aes(conct, fill = quality)) +\n  geom_bar(alpha = .7, color = \"#222222\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(scale = .05)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#00cc00\", \"#ffcc00\", \"#ff3300\")) +\n  labs(x = \"Roll Configuration\", y = NULL, fill = NULL) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"top\")\n```\n\nAs we can see, the results largely scale up the same, although in _Blades in the Dark_ rolls are more forgiving than in _Apocalypse World_; out otherwise, the success rates in BitD are generally a little higher. This suits the general vibes of the games: in BitD, the consequences of failing are more dire overall, therefore it's kinda fair you don't fail too easy or often. Let's take a look at _Shadowrun_, though. First at the raw number of successes (5s and 6s) and then by setting some thresholds to shoehorn everything into three success qualities.\n\n```{r sim_sr}\nsr_base <- map(1:16, ~roll_d6(., n_rolls, \"success\"))\nnames(sr_base) <- paste0(1:16, \"d6\")\nsr6 <- sr_base %>% \n  as_tibble() %>% \n  gather(dice, result) %>% \n  mutate(\n    dice_lab = factor(dice) |> fct_inorder(),\n    dice_n   = as.numeric(dice_lab),\n    result_neg = dice_n - result\n  )\n\nggplot(sr6, aes(dice_n, result)) +\n  # facet_wrap(~dice)\n  geom_jitter(width = .3, height = .3,\n              size = .1, alpha = .5)\n\nggplot(sr6, aes(result)) +\n  facet_wrap(~dice_lab, nrow = 4) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = \"#222222\") +\n  labs(\n    y = \"Number of rolls\", \n    x = \"Number of successes\"\n  )\n```\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":true,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"html-math-method":"katex","output-file":"skillcheck.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","editor":"visual","theme":{"light":"darkly","dark":"darkly"},"smooth-scroll":true,"title":"Skill Check Comparison","author":"Tobias"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
